EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS

The 'simple_rx' application illustrates the various steps to receive packets
directly into a user-space AVB application.

The simple rx application requires root permissions to execute and 
attach to the driver.
	sudo ./simple_rx -i enp3s0 -f out.wav

To exit the app, hit Ctrl-C. The application gracefully tears down
the connection to the driver. If the application unexpectedly aborts the
kernel-mode driver also reclaims the various buffers and attempts to clean up.
The application should be able to re-initialize and use the transmit queues
without restarting the driver.

To build the application, you need to have the pciutils library
installed. the latest version can be downloaded from:

	< ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/utils/pciutils/ >.

Download and extract the library, and run 'make;make install;make install-lib'.
